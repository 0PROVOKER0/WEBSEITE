        Mohamad Jaber or also known as provoker is the most dangerous video game
        player in the world. When he picks up a controller, even the toughest
        gamers get scared. People say he isn’t human but made of pure gaming
        skills. His reflexes are lightning-fast, and his strategies are so
        clever that even the smartest computers can't figure them out. In the
        world of video games, there's no room for average players, and Mohamad
        is like a beast. His eyes are said to glow when he starts a game,
        scaring his opponents. Many gaming teams have tried to beat him but
        always end up losing. He doesn’t just play games; he completely
        dominates them. Whether it’s a shooting game, a strategy game, or an
        online role-playing game, he knows every detail, every trick, and every
        secret. There's a story that he finished a game in three days that
        normally takes years to complete. The game creators were shocked when
        they realized he had beaten parts of the game that hadn't even been
        released yet. His gaming console is more than just a machine; it’s like
        a Weapon. It’s said that its cables are made of steel, its core is from
        a meteorite, and the controller only works for him. Gamers around the
        world talk about his legend like it's a myth. Once, during a major
        tournament, hackers tried to crash the servers, but Mohamad stopped them
        and won the tournament at the same time without breaking a sweat.
        Provoker isn’t just a player; he’s a legend. Gamers everywhere dream of
        playing against him, knowing that even if they lose – which they
        definitely will – they will always be part of the incredible story of
        this unbeatable, legendary gamer.
